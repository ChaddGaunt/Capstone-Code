# Capstone-Code

The ‘anchor_xyz_plot.m’ is the main script I’ve been using to plot my anchors and trajectories.

The ‘Interpolated_data.xlsx’ contains the synchronised raw UWB data and the LiDAR data.

The  ‘PF_var_2.5_associate_10.csv’ contains example output data from the PF code.

I have also uploaded the PF code I have been working on in the ‘PF’ folder for convenience. 

The 'UWB Device Locations AdNav.csv' contains the locations of the anchors according to the AdNav self surveying algorithm.

The 'Interpolate_Data.m' script was used to syncronise the LiDAR data with the Raw UWB data.
